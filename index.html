           Q. A characteristic of Big Data is that:
            it involves formats with diverse types of structures.
            
             Big Data is collected from many different sources and is in a variety of formats, including structured data (e.g., SQL tables or CSV files), semi-structured data (e.g., HTML code), and unstructured data (e.g., video messages).

            <div class="box box1">Q. In the use of machine learning (ML): training data can be learned too precisely, resulting in inaccurate predictions when used with different datasets.
                Overfitting occurs when the ML model learns the input and target dataset too precisely. In this case, the model has been “over trained” on the data and is treating noise in the data as true parameters. An ML model that has been overfitted is not able to accurately predict outcomes using a different dataset and may be too complex.

           <div class="box box1"><p>Q. Which of the following pooled investments is most likely characterized by a few large investments? Buyout funds or private equity firms make only a few large investments in private companies with the intent of selling the restructured companies in three to five years. Venture capital funds also have a short time horizon; however, these funds consist of many small investments in companies with the expectation that only a few will have a large payoff (and that most will fail).</p>

                The geometric mean return compounds the returns instead of the amount invested.

                Q. A factor associated with the widespread adoption of algorithmic trading is increased:trading destinations.
                Global financial markets have undergone substantial change as markets have fragmented into multiple trading destinations consisting of electronic exchanges, alternative trading systems, and so-called dark pools. In such an environment, when markets are continuously reflecting real-time information and continuously changing conditions, algorithmic trading has been viewed as an important tool.

                Through tokenization—the process of representing ownership rights to physical assets on a blockchain or distributed ledger—DLT has the potential to streamline this rights process by creating a single, digital record of ownership with which to verify ownership title and authenticity, including all historical activity.</div>

    Q:
    A major benefit of employing a risk budgeting process is that it most likely:forces risk tradeoffs across the organization.
    Adding a risk budgeting process causes the organization to consider how its total risk tolerance will be allocated across its subsidiaries. Either the total current risks the subsidiaries are engaging in will exceed the risk tolerance and subsidiaries will have to compete for risk by demonstrating highest returns per unit of risk or the total current risks will be less than the risk tolerance and a search will be underway for the subsidiaries that can best utilize the remaining risk budget. The risk tolerance is determined and then sets the risk budget, rather than being determined by it. Hedging can be a part of risk budgeting if hedging produces the superior risk adjusted returns.

    Q. In providing investment services, robo-advisers are most likely to:offer fairly conservative advice as easily accessible guidance.
    Research suggests that robo-advisers tend to offer fairly conservative advice, providing a cost-effective and easily accessible form of financial guidance to underserved populations, such as the mass affluent and mass market segments.

                The price of gold in nominal dollars was several orders of magnitude cheaper 100 years ago than it is today (roughly US$20 then versus US$1,100 today). Such a wide range of prices lends itself well to being graphically displayed on a logarithmic scale.

                Through the Text Analytics application of natural language processing (NLP), 
                models using NLP analysis may incorporate non-traditional information to evaluate what people are saying—via their preferences, opinions, likes, or dislikes—in the attempt to identify trends and short-term indicators about a company, a stock, or an economic event that might have a bearing on future performance.

            <p>Among other things, an organization’s risk tolerance should most likely reflect its: competitive position. An organization with a strong competitive position can recover from losses more easily than one with a weaker competitive position. Therefore an organization’s risk tolerance should reflect its competitive position. An organization’s size does not define the risk sources it faces or the relative losses it can absorb, so it should not be reflected in its risk tolerance. Neither the risk sources affecting an organization nor the size of the losses an organization can absorb are a function of its perception of market stability.</p>
