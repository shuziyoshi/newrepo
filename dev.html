<p>Q. Which of the following derivatives provide payoffs that are non-linearly related to the payoffs of the underlying?</p>    
<p>Options are classified as a contingent claim which provides payoffs that are non-linearly related to the performance of the underlying.</p>

<p>Q. In a declining interest rate environment, compared with a CMOâ€™s Class A tranche, its Class C tranche will be repaid:earlier.</p>
<p>Lower interest rates entice homeowners to pay off their mortgages early because they can refinance at lower rates. The most junior tranche in a CMO will bear the first wave of prepayments until that tranche has been completely repaid its full principal investment. At that point, the next tranche will bear prepayments until that tranche has been fully repaid. Therefore, the Class C tranche of a CMO will be repaid before the more senior Class A tranche.</p>
