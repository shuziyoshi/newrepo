    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;font-family: Lobster;"> UTILITY THEORY AND INDIFFERENCE CURVES</h2></header>

<h1 class="learning-outcome">
    <li>Learning Outcome:
    explain risk aversion and its implications for portfolio selection</li></h1>

<p>Because individuals are different in their preferences, all risk-averse individuals may not rank investment alternatives in the same manner. Consider the £50 gamble again. All risk-averse individuals will rank the guaranteed outcome of £50 higher than the gamble. What if the guaranteed outcome is only £40? Some risk-averse investors might consider £40 inadequate, others might accept it, and still others may now be indifferent about the uncertain £50 and the certain £40.
<div><p>
    We can draw several conclusions from the utility function. First, utility is unbounded on both sides. It can be highly positive or highly negative. Second, higher return contributes to higher utility. Third, higher variance reduces the utility but the reduction in utility gets amplified by the risk aversion coefficient, A. Utility can always be increased, albeit marginally, by getting higher return or lower risk. Fourth, utility does not indicate or measure satisfaction itself—it can be useful only in ranking various investments. For example, a portfolio with a utility of 4 is not necessarily two times better than a portfolio with a utility of 2. The portfolio with a utility of 4 could increase our happiness 10 times or just marginally. But we do prefer a portfolio with a utility of 4 to a portfolio with a utility of 2. Utility cannot be compared among individuals or investors because it is a very personal concept. From a societal point of view, by the same argument, utility cannot be summed among individuals.
</p></div>
    Let us explore the utility function further. The risk aversion coefficient, A, is greater than zero for a risk-averse investor. So any increase in risk reduces his/her utility. The risk aversion coefficient for a risk-neutral investor is 0, and changes in risk do not affect his/her utility. For a risk lover, the risk aversion coefficient is negative, creating an inverse situation so that additional risk contributes to an increase in his/her utility. Note that a risk-free asset (σ2 = 0) generates the same utility for all individuals.</p>
<p>U=E(r)−1/2Aσ^2
    where, U is the utility of an investment, E(r) is the expected return, and σ2 is the variance of the investment.

<h2 style="color: blueviolet;font-family: Lobster;"> APPLICATION OF UTILITY THEORY TO PORTFOLIO SELECTION
</h2>
<h1 class="learning-outcome">
<li>Learning Outcomes:
    explain risk aversion and its implications for portfolio selection; 

    explain the selection of an optimal portfolio, given an investor’s utility (or risk aversion) and the capital allocation line</li></h1>
    <div><p>The CAL is the combination of the risk-free asset with zero risk and the portfolio of all risky assets that provides for the set of feasible investments. Allowing for borrowing at the risk-free rate and investing in the portfolio of all risky assets provides for attainable portfolios that dominate risky assets below the CAL.
    </p></div>
    <p>The CAL represents the set of all feasible investments. Each investor’s indifference curve determines the optimal combination of the risk-free asset and the portfolio of all risky assets, which must lie on the CAL.

<h2 style="color: blueviolet;font-family: Lobster;">PORTFOLIO RISK & PORTFOLIO OF TWO RISKY ASSETS</h2>
<h1 class="learning-outcome"><li>Portfolio Return</li></h1>
<div><p>When two individual assets are combined in a portfolio, we can compute the portfolio return as a weighted average of the returns of the two assets. Consider Assets 1 and 2 with weights of 25 percent and 75 percent in a portfolio. If their returns are 20 percent and 5 percent, the weighted average return = (0.25 × 20%) + (0.75 × 5%) = 8.75%. More generally, the portfolio return can be written as below, where Rp is return of the portfolio, w1 and w2 are the weights of the two assets, and R1, R2 are returns on the two assets:

    Rp=w1R1+(1−w1)R2</p>

    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;font-family: Lobster;"></h2>LOS 52.a: Compare and contrast cognitive errors and emotional biases.</h2>
    
    
    <p>Individuals, when facing complex decision-making, often lack the time or ability to derive the optimal course of action prescribed by traditional finance. Cognitive limitations and emotional responses introduce bias into the decision-making process, leading to decisions that are biased (not perfectly rational). Behavioral finance asserts that certain biases, which are not simply random errors, are widespread and therefore predictable.
    
    Cognitive errors are due primarily to faulty reasoning or irrationality. They can arise from not understanding statistical analysis, information processing errors, illogical reasoning, or memory errors. Such errors can possibly be reduced by increased awareness, better training, or more information.
    
    Emotional biases are not related to conscious thought. Rather, they stem from feelings, impulses, or intuition. As such, they are difficult to overcome and may have to be accommodated.
    
    Despite the distinction in grouping biases as either cognitive or emotional, a bias may have elements of both cognition and emotion. When trying to overcome or mitigate biases that are both emotional and cognitive, success is more likely by focusing on the cognitive issues.
